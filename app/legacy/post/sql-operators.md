Understanding how data flows in your applications is one of the most important skills for a developer&mdash;and that data starts and ends at the database.

To query the database we write SQL queries, and those queries need to filter the data down to the specific data and format we need.

In a SQL query, the majority of the filtering happens in the `WHERE` clause.

I've written a post over on freeCodeCamp's _Developer News_ that covers basically every useful way to filter a sql query: it's called [SQL Operators Tutorial – Bitwise, Comparison, Arithmetic, and Logical Operator Query Examples.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sql-operators-tutorial/)

Enjoy! Thanks for reading.
