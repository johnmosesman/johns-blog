In 2018 I gave a talk to a local chapter of freeCodeCamp here in Oklahoma City called _"How To Become A Developer."_

I enjoyed giving the talk, and even though there were only a dozen or so people who attended, I thought it was a good talk and that it had a lot of valuable advice in there.

What I didn't expect however, was that the local OKC broadcast of that talk would be picked up by the main freeCodeCamp channel&mdash;where it got 300k views.

Since 2018, I've changed as a person and as a developer, and the development world has changed as well.

Because of that, I wanted to update the advice I gave in 2018. Some of my stances have changed, and some of the things I said in that original talk could have used better explanations.

I've recorded a video highlighting important sections from that talk that I think I need to address&mdash;as well as answered all of the comments left on the video.
