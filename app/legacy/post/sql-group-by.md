For years `GROUP BY` in SQL always confused me. It's a weird concept. You can't really see the grouping happening&mdash;you just act on the grouped result.

With enough practice, you can learn how to solve a variety of problems and segment your data to produce useful analytics and insights by using `GROUP BY`.

[I've written a tutorial on `GROUP BY`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sql-group-by-clauses-explained/) on freeCodeCamp's _Developer News_.

In this article I show how the `GROUP BY` clause works, the various aggregations you can perform on the grouped result set (like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG`), and how to filter the grouped result using the `HAVING` clause.

I hope you enjoy it and again thanks for reading!
