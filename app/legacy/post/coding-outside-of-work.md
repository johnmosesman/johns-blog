Ah coding outside of work. A hot topic, but an important one too.

Should you code outside of work? Why should you? How _long_ should you?

I wrote an article on freeCodeCamp's _Developer News_ that breaks down every facet of coding outside of work&mdash;the career benefits, the burnout, and everything in between.

You can [read that post here.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lets-talk-about-coding-outside-of-work/)

I hope you enjoy it and again thanks for reading.
