One of the most powerful and useful concepts in our relational database world is the **join.**

Joins allow us to re-associate our separated and normalized database tables.

Joins form the relationships between the entities in our apps by combining result sets from different tables into one result, or by allowing us to filter the result based on associated information.

[I wrote a tutorial on joins](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sql-joins-tutorial/) on freeCodeCamp's _Developer News_.

I hope you enjoy it and again thanks for reading!
