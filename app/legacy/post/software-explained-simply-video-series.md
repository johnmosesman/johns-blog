Hello all!

Based on the feedback I've gotten from my talk on [How To Become A Developer](/post/talk-how-to-become-a-developer), I've started a YouTube series called _Software Explained Simply_.

I've heard from a lot of people that really want to become developers, but they don't know what path to follow. So in this series I'm starting from the ground-up and explaining software concepts, well, simply! If you've never written a single line of code you are right at home starting with Episode 1.

In each episode I will explain the concepts and give examples of each topic, and at the end of each episode I'll have a set of homework exercises for you to do to learn on your own.

If that interests you, you can find all of the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmTbSmV8mwCFG6-p1s7OsG_G41g9UlIx6), and I've included the first episode below.

Thanks!

John
