After writing my _How To Become A Developer_ series on this blog, I was asked to give a talk on it!

Giving this talk was a lot of fun for me, and has seemed to help a lot of people get started learning how to program. It was also nice to have the ability to articulate the entire narrative in one setting.

If you'd like to watch it, here's the video:
