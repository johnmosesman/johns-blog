__07/02/2019 Update:__ I've always wanted to expound on the steps listed here, and I've just started doing that. I want to lay out a path for people who want to become developers to follow. I can't do the work for you, but I can help show you the work that needs to be done.

The first of these posts is here, and it's about [picking your first programming language.]({{< ref "how-to-pick-a-programming-language.md" >}})

Thanks!

Finally here we are. Here are the steps I suggest people take to become a developer. In parts [1](/post/how-to-become-a-developer), [2](/post/skills-you-need-as-a-developer), and [3](/post/what-type-of-developer-are-you) I talked about some of the things around becoming a developer. This post is all about _how_ to become a developer. The steps are short and sweet, but effective.

## Step 1: Become familiar with the syntax

The first step is to begin to become familiar with the syntax of programming languages and learn a couple of keywords. The more familiar you are with the syntax the less you will fight it while trying to learn the programming concepts. For this reason, I recommend people go through some introductory courses on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby first. There are a number of places where you can do this for free online, such as [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [Codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/), [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0), etc. Most of these tutorials are also interactive in the browser.

## Step 2: The Rails book

After you're done some intro courses to the various programming languages you'll need, it's time for [the Rails book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book). This is a free book by Michael Hartl that will walk you through step-by-step almost all of the concepts you need to know to build a web app. This is a fairly meaty book--but just work through it a chapter at a time.

## Step 3: Learn concepts not mentioned in the book

I've written a worksheet to work through some other concepts that I think the book is missing or didn't touch on enough. You can [see it here](https://github.com/johnmosesman/after_the_rails_book/blob/master/after_the_rails_book.md). It shouldn't take too long to work through this, and it will introduce you to very common concepts and practices in web programming.

## Step 4: Keep learning and making your own projects while you get that job!

More details to come here, but at this point you're ready to start looking for entry-level Rails gigs. Don't stop learning and increasing your knowledge though--there's a lot more to learn! Even if you're just creating silly Hello World apps, showing that you have created _something_ and that you're continuning to learn is a big deal for future employers.

Good luck!
