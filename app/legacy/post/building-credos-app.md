There's this app I want to exist, and so I decided I'm going to make it.

But, I thought it would interesting and possibly a great learning resource to record myself making it and upload it all to YouTube. From `rails new` all the way to deploying it to production, I'll record and show it all.

Below is the intro video explaining what the app is and why I want to make it, and then below that is my first working session where I start to scaffold out the data model and add user authentication.

If that sounds interesting to you, I'll be uploading all of the videos to this playlist [here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmTbSmV8mwCFjFibONas3S5mADUmDgjEv)

Feel free to ask me any questions or comments you have in a comment on the video or [on twitter](https://twitter.com/johnmosesman/).

Thanks!

John
