Git is one of the most important skills you pick up as a developer.

You use it every day, and it is the foundation of many of the mature software engineering practices we use every day.

I've written a [thorough tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/practical-git-and-git-workflows/) building from-the-ground-up the basics of how to use Git and collaborate with others on freeCodeCamp's _Developer News_.

Here's what it covers:

> * Installing git and setting up a GitHub account
> * How to create a new repository in GitHub
> * Cloning the repository
> * Git branches
> * How the check the status of a Git project
> * How to make our first commit
> * How to push up our first commit to GitHub
> * How to add another commit in Git
> * How to stage changes in Git
> * How to view the Git diff
> * How to collaborate with others in Git
> * Feature branches in Git
> * Git workflows for collaboration
> * How to merge a branch in Git
> * Pull request workflow
> * How to bring our local up to date
> * How to retrieve remote data
> * How to fix merge conflicts in Git
> * Review: how to start a new feature workflow
